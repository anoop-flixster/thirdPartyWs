Represents a third party Web Service.

This Web Service is dirt simple and provides a GET endpoint and a configurable delay (in milliseconds) as paramater.

The delay paramater value's used by the controller to add that delay to the API response.

This implementation is done in a non-blocking manner to enable this Play service to be as scalable as possible.


Sample API calls:

- GET xxx?delay=100 => A delay of 100 ms is added to each API call by the controller
- GET xxx?delay=1000 => A delay of 1,000 ms is added to each API call by the controller
- GET xxx => If no delay is specified, a random delay between 0 ms and 10,000 ms is chosen for each API call.
